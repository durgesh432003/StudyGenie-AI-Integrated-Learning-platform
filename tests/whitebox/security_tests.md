# Security Testing for AI Study Material Generator

## Overview

Security testing is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in the application that could be exploited by malicious actors. This document outlines the security testing approach for the AI Study Material Generator.

## Authentication & Authorization Testing

### Test Case 1: Authentication Bypass
**Objective**: Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes.
**Method**: 
1. Attempt to access protected routes without authentication
2. Check for proper redirection to login page
**Code to Test**:
- Middleware.js (Clerk authentication)
- Protected API routes

### Test Case 2: Authorization Checks
**Objective**: Verify that users can only access their own data.
**Method**:
1. Create two test users
2. Have one user attempt to access another user's courses
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check in API routes like this
if (course.createdBy !== user.primaryEmailAddress.emailAddress) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 403 });
}
```

## Input Validation Testing

### Test Case 3: API Input Validation
**Objective**: Verify that all API inputs are properly validated.
**Method**:
1. Send malformed requests to API endpoints
2. Test with missing required fields
3. Test with invalid data types
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// In generate-course-outline/route.js
if (!courseId || !topic || !courseType || !difficultyLevel || !createdBy) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Missing required fields" },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### Test Case 4: SQL Injection Prevention
**Objective**: Verify that the application is protected against SQL injection.
**Method**:
1. Test database queries with malicious input
2. Verify that parameterized queries or ORM features are used
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check that all database queries use Drizzle ORM properly
const result = await db
  .select()
  .from(USER_TABLE)
  .where(eq(USER_TABLE.email, user.primaryEmailAddress.emailAddress));
```

## Data Protection Testing

### Test Case 5: Sensitive Data Exposure
**Objective**: Verify that sensitive data is not exposed in responses.
**Method**:
1. Check API responses for sensitive information
2. Verify that database credentials are not exposed
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check for sensitive data in API responses
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true, 
  message: "Course generation started",
  courseId: initialDbResult[0].courseId
  // Should not include full user details, credentials, etc.
});
```

### Test Case 6: HTTPS Usage
**Objective**: Verify that all communication uses HTTPS.
**Method**:
1. Check for HTTP links in the application
2. Verify that cookies are secure
**Code to Test**:
- Next.js configuration
- API calls in frontend components

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

### Test Case 7: Output Encoding
**Objective**: Verify that user-generated content is properly encoded.
**Method**:
1. Insert script tags in user inputs
2. Check if they are executed when displayed
**Code to Test**:
```jsx
// Check React components that display user input
<div>{userProvidedContent}</div> // Should be safe in React, but verify
```

### Test Case 8: Content Security Policy
**Objective**: Verify that a proper Content Security Policy is in place.
**Method**:
1. Check for CSP headers
2. Attempt to execute inline scripts
**Code to Test**:
- Next.js configuration
- HTTP response headers

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

### Test Case 9: CSRF Tokens
**Objective**: Verify that CSRF protection is implemented.
**Method**:
1. Attempt to perform state-changing operations from a different origin
**Code to Test**:
- API routes that modify data
- Form submissions

## Rate Limiting

### Test Case 10: API Rate Limiting
**Objective**: Verify that API endpoints are protected against abuse.
**Method**:
1. Send multiple requests in quick succession
2. Verify that rate limiting is applied
**Code to Test**:
- API middleware
- Rate limiting configuration

## Dependency Security

### Test Case 11: Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Objective**: Verify that dependencies are free from known vulnerabilities.
**Method**:
1. Run npm audit
2. Check for outdated packages
**Code to Test**:
- package.json
- package-lock.json

## Code Implementation Security Tests

### Test Case 12: Secure Random Values
**Objective**: Verify that cryptographically secure random values are used.
**Method**:
1. Check usage of random value generation
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check for secure UUID generation
const courseId = uuidv4(); // This is fine for non-security-critical IDs
```

### Test Case 13: Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify that errors are handled securely.
**Method**:
1. Trigger errors in the application
2. Check that sensitive information is not leaked in error messages
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check error handling in API routes
catch (error) {
  console.error("Error in generate-course-outline:", error);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Internal Server Error", details: error.message }, // Be careful with exposing error.message
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

### Test Case 14: Secure Database Configuration
**Objective**: Verify that the database is configured securely.
**Method**:
1. Check database connection configuration
2. Verify that credentials are stored securely
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check database configuration
const DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Z7eQodKErL8C@ep-delicate-queen-a8nndo95-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/ai-study-material-gen?sslmode=require";
// This should be in an environment variable, not hardcoded
```

### Test Case 15: Protected Admin Routes
**Objective**: Verify that admin functionality is properly protected.
**Method**:
1. Attempt to access admin routes as a regular user
**Code to Test**:
```javascript
// Check admin route protection
// In app/api/admin/run-migrations/route.js
export async function POST(req) {
  try {
    // In production, you would add authentication here
    // For example, check for an admin token
    
    const result = await addDatabaseIndexes();
    // ...
  }
}
```
